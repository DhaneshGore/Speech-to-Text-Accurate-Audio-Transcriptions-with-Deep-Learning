## Features

- End-to-end transcription of WAV audio files
- High accuracy achieved through machine learning techniques
- User-friendly interface built in Jupyter Notebook

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DhaneshGore/wav_to_text.git
   cd wav_to_text
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment** (if not already set up)
   ```bash
   conda create -p venv python==3.7 -y
   conda activate venv
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**
   - Open `Facebook's_Wav2vec2_model_speech_to_text_application.ipynb` in a Jupyter environment.
   - Follow the instructions to load audio files and run the transcription model.

2. **Test with Example Audio Files**
   - Place your `.wav` files in the specified directory within the project.
   - Run the cells to preprocess audio files and obtain transcriptions.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Wav2Vec2**: Deep learning model for speech recognition
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **SciPy**: For audio data handling
- **IPython.display**: For audio playback in Jupyter
- **pandas**: For data manipulation (if used)
- **NumPy**: For numerical computing (if used)
